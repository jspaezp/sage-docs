# Continuous Integration/Testing

Sage is battle tested - in addition to having searched well over a billion spectra (across 10,000s of files)
as part of its development, Sage undergoes automated testing on every code change.
Many of these tests ensure the correctness of key functions and algorithms. 
In addition to unit testing individuals parts of Sage, end-to-end testing is also performed
on full sized datasets from PRIDE. This enables monitoring performance and identifiation stability over time.

Benchmarks are currently
performed on an ARM aarch64 virtual machine with 8 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM.
