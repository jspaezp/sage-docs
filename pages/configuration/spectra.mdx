# Spectral processing

- `min_peaks`: Integer. Only process MS2 spectra with at least N peaks (default: 15).
- `max_peaks`: Integer. Take the top N most intense MS2 peaks to search (default: 150).
- `min_matched_peaks`: Integer. The minimum number of matched b+y ions required for scoring and reporting PSMs (default: 4).
- `max_fragment_charge`: Integer. The maximum fragment ion charge states to consider (default: null - use precursor z-1).

Sage does not perform any transformations on spectral intensity. 

If `deisotope` is turned on, Sage will attempt to deisotope and deconvolute the charge state of fragment ions in an MS2 spectra. 
This can speed up searches on high-res MS/MS data. 

`max_fragment_charge`, by default, will search each fragment several times against the fragment index with different charge states (up to `precursor_charge - 1`) to try and find candidate peptides - at the cost of increased run time. 
If `deisotope` is turned off, it is recommended to set `max_fragment_charge = 1`.

**Recommended settings for high-res MS/MS**
```json filename="high res MS/MS" copy
{
    "deisotope": true,
    "min_peaks": 15,
    "max_peaks": 150,
    "min_matched_peaks": 4,
    "max_fragment_charge": 1,
}
```

**Recommended settings for low-res MS/MS**
```json filename="low res MS/MS" copy
{
    "deisotope": false,
    "min_peaks": 15,
    "max_peaks": 150,
    "min_matched_peaks": 4,
    "max_fragment_charge": 2,
}
```
