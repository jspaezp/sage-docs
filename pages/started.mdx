# Getting Started
 
<Steps>
### Convert your files to mzML
 
Sage aims for full compatibility with the mzML specification, and has been extensively tested on files from the following two conversion tools:

1. [msConvert](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/download.html)
- Enable peak-picking/centroiding for MS1 spectra 
- Do not use numpress

2. [ThermoRawFileParser](https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser)
- Sage can be used to calculate TMT S/N measurements if ThermoRawFileParser is configured to write noise values into the mzML

Sage can directly read gzipped-mzMLs, as well as mzMLs with internal zlib compression of m/z and intensity values. I generally recommend writing 32-bit, compressed values to mzMLs.
 
### Download or install the latest version of Sage
 
Check out the [installation page](/installation)! 

There are several easy ways to download Sage - you don't need to install any additional software, packages, or runtimes to use it.

### Run Sage

Please see the [configuration section](/configuration) for details!

```bash 
# Everything can be configured from a single file
sage experiment_242.json

# Or you can set some arguments from the command line!
sage base_config.json -f human.fasta --write-pin *.mzML
```
