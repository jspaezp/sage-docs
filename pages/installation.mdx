# Installation

Sage is specifically designed to be easy to install and run. There are several ways to get started:

1. Download the latest binary release (recommended)
2. Compile from source code
3. Install via bioconda
4. Run via Docker

## Download the latest binary release

This is the easiest way to run Sage - Sage uses a continuous integration/deployment system to automatically compile binaries and publically distribute them as [Github Releases](https://github.com/lazear/sage/releases).

Visit this link and download the file corresponding to your operating system and CPU architecture.

Most users will probably want one of the following:

| Configuration | Binary |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Mac, Apple Silicon | `aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Mac, Intel | `x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| Windows | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| Linux | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |

Additional binary builds are supplied for other, less-common configurations


## Compile from source code

 - Install the [Rust programming language compiler](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain

Once you have Rust installed, you can copy and paste the following lines of code into your terminal (assuming you have git installed!)
```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/lazear/sage.git
cd sage
cargo run --release tests/config.json
```

## Install via bioconda

Sage can be installed from [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/sage-proteomics):

```bash copy
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge sage-proteomics
sage --help
```

## Run via Docker

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/lazear/sage:master
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/data ghcr.io/lazear/sage:master /app/sage -o /data /data/config.json
```

> `-v ${PWD}:/data` means it will mount your current directory as `/data`
> in the docker image. Make sure all the paths in your command and configuration
> use the location in the image and not your local directory
