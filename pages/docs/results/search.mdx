# Search Results

Search results can be found in the `results.sage.tsv` file. The table below describes the columns that are present in this file.

| Header | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `peptide` | Peptide sequence, including modifications in ProForma format (e.g., NC\[+57.021\]HKGSFK). |

| `delta_next` | Difference between the hyperscore of this candidate and the next best candidate. |
| `delta_bext` | Difference between the hyperscore of the best candidate (rank=1) and this candidate. |
| `rt` | Retention time in minutes. |
| `aligned_rt` | Globally aligned retention time. |
| `predicted_rt` | Predicted retention time, if enabled. |
| `delta_rt_model` | Difference between predicted and observed retention time. |

| `matched_peaks` | Number of matched theoretical fragment ions. |
| `longest_b` | Longest b-ion series. |
| `longest_y` | Longest y-ion series. |
| `longest_y_pct` | Longest y-ion series, divided by peptide length (as a fraction). |
| `matched_intensity_pct` | Fraction of MS2 intensity explained by matched b- and y-ions (as a percentage of total MS2 intensity for this spectrum). |
| `scored_candidates` | Number of scored candidates for this spectrum. |
| `poisson` | Probability of matching exactly N peaks across all scored candidates (Pr(x=k)). |
