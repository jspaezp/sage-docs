# Additional Settings 

## Chimeric search and reporting multiple PSMs

Sage is capable of searching for chimeric/co-fragmenting PSMs in any search configuration. This feature requires that `report_psms > 1` to have any special effect.
During the search phase, Sage will find the best candidate peptide for a spectrum (highest hyperscore), and then subtract the most intense MS2 peak matching each 
fragment ion from that peptide. Sage will then search the subtracted spectrum again, and repeat the above step until `report_psms` candidates have been found for the
spectrum, or there are fewer than `min_peaks` MS2 peaks remaining in the spectra.

- `chimera`: Boolean. Search for chimeric/co-fragmenting PSMs (default: false).
- `report_psms`: Integer. The number of PSMs to report for each spectrum. Higher values might disrupt re-scoring, it is best to search with multiple values (default: 1).

## Retention Time Prediction

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
You probably don't want to turn this off without good reason!

Sage's LFQ module **requires** that global RT alignment and prediction is performed, and will turn on this feature even if you turn it off. 
</Callout>

By default, Sage will align retention times across all files in the search by matching RTs for the most confident PSMs shared between runs.

> Global retention time alignment is performed using a modified algorithm based on [Chen AT, et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31260443/)

1. Transform all RTs into unit-less percentages (0.0 - 1.0)
2. Assume that the expected RT for a peptide can be estimated from the average
RT across all runs
3. For each run, calculate a linear regression between the observed peptide RTs
and the global average. Transform all PSM retention times by the regression
parameters
4.  Following global RT alignment, Sage will then build a RT prediction model, and integrate this information as a feature for PSM rescoring.

If, for some reason, you would prefer the above to be turned off, you can do via the `predict_rt` flag. 

```json copy
{
    // Oh no!
    "predict_rt": false
}
```
