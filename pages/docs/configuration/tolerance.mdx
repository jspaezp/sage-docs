# Search Tolerances

Several parameters can impact precursor and fragment tolerances during the database search phase.


```json copy
{
    "precursor_tol": {
        "da": [
            -500,
            100
        ]
    },
    "fragment_tol": {
        "ppm": [
            -10,
            10
        ]
    },
    "isotope_errors": [0, 3],
    "wide_window": false
}
```

## Precursor Tolerance

This parameters specifices whether an absolute (`"da"`) or relative (`"ppm"`) tolerance is used for selecting candidate matches. 
Sage applies the "left" side of the tolerance to the experimental mass - this means that typical open-searches (i.e looking for a positive delta mass arising from a chemical modification)
will want to use a large negative value here. Using the above configuration, an MS2 spectrum with a 2700 Da precursor mass would search for candidate peptides with a mass between 2200 and 2800 Da.

A standard "closed search" might use the following configuration:

```json filename="closed search" copy
{
    "precursor_tol": { "ppm": [-20, 20] }
}
```

## Fragment Tolerance

Similar to above, you can select whether to use absolute or relative tolerances:

**For high-res MS/MS:**
```json filename="High res MS/MS" copy
{
    "fragment_tol": { "ppm": [-10, 10] }
}
```

**Or for low-res MS/MS:**
```json filename="Low res MS/MS" copy
{
    "fragment_tol": { "da": [-0.4, 0.4] }
}
```

## Isotope Errors

This parameter essentially runs a multi-notch or mass offset search for each integer value in the (`left` .. `right`) range by multipyling the integer value by the mass difference of one C13 neutron.
This can account for incorrect assignment or sequening of the monoisotopic peak.

**Default value**:
```json copy
{
    "isotope_errors": [0, 0]
}
```

**Typical values**:
```json copy
{
    "isotope_errors": [0, 3]
}
```


## Wide-window mode

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
Setting `wide_window` will **override** `precursor_tol`!
</Callout>

This parameter instructs Sage to dynamically change the precursor tolerance for each spectra based on the isolation window encoded in the mzML file.
This is useful for searching wide-window acquisition (WWA) data, parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM), or data-independent acquisition (DIA) data.
You probably also want to update the following settings as well if you are running a WWA/PRM/DIA search:

```json copy
{
    "wide_window": true,
    "chimera": true,
    // Try running multiple searches with different `report_psms` values
    "report_psms": 5
}
```
