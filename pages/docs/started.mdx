# Getting Started
 
<Steps>
### Convert your files to mzML
 
Sage aims for full compatibility with the mzML specification, and has been extensively tested on files from the following two conversion tools:

1. [msConvert](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/download.html)
- Enable peak-picking/centroiding for MS1 spectra 
- Do not use numpress

2. [ThermoRawFileParser](https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser)
- Sage can be used to calculate TMT S/N measurements if ThermoRawFileParser is configured to write noise values into the mzML

Sage can directly read gzipped-mzMLs, as well as mzMLs with internal zlib compression of m/z and intensity values. I generally recommend writing 32-bit, compressed values to mzMLs.
 
### Download or install the latest version of Sage
 
There are several easy ways to download Sage - you don't need to install any additional software, packages, or runtimes to use it:

1. Download the latest binary release (recommended)
2. Compile from source code
3. Install via bioconda
4. Run via Docker

#### Download the latest binary release

This is the easiest way to run Sage - Sage uses a continuous integration/deployment system to automatically compile binaries and publically distribute them as [Github Releases](https://github.com/lazear/sage/releases).

Visit this link and download the file corresponding to your operating system and CPU architecture.

Most users will probably want one of the following:

| Configuration | Binary |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Mac, Apple Silicon | `aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Mac, Intel | `x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| Windows | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| Linux | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |

Additional binary builds are supplied for other, less-common configurations


#### Compile from source code

 - Install the [Rust programming language compiler](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain

Once you have Rust installed, you can copy and paste the following lines of code into your terminal (assuming you have git installed!)
```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/lazear/sage.git
cd sage
cargo run --release tests/config.json
```

#### Install via bioconda

Sage can be installed from [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/sage-proteomics):

```bash copy
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge sage-proteomics
sage --help
```

#### Run via Docker

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/lazear/sage:latest
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/data ghcr.io/lazear/sage:latest /app/sage -o /data /data/config.json
```

> `-v ${PWD}:/data` will mount your current directory as `/data`
> in the docker image. Make sure all the paths in your command and configuration
> use the location in the image and not your local directory

### Run Sage

Please see the [configuration section](/docs/configuration) for details. Understanding [how Sage works](/docs/how_it_works) might also be useful!

Once you're ready to go, run Sage via the command line:

```bash 
# Everything can be configured from a single file
sage experiment_242.json

# Or you can set some arguments from the command line!
sage base_config.json -f human.fasta --write-pin *.mzML
```

### Interpret results

Please see the [results section](/docs/results) for details!
